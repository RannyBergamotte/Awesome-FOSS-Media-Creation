# Awesome-FOSS-Media-Creation

Relinquish yourself from Adobe's subscription grasp: 
Here's some (honestly) better software in my opinion:

## Image Manipulation/Graphics
Photoshop (Image Manipulation) --> [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org) (pretty crappy UI, definetly not as good, but will get the job done. They are working on a UI upgrade and refactoring of the code base for the next release)
Illustrator (Vector Graphics) --> [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) (Inkscape is absolutely awesome, and there are features that do actually surpass Illustrator)
Photoshop/Procreate (Digital Drawing) --> [Krita](https://krita.org/en/)
Lightroom (Image organization/processing) --> Darktable (https://www.darktable.org) (Also integrates with GIMP)

I like to think of GIMP-Inkscape-Krita as the triangle of FOSS (free and open source software) image creation: the three of them together, you can pretty much do anything you want for images.

## Video/Motion Graphics with Time
Adobe Premiere --> [Davinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve) (Even though not open-source, it is free and an absolutely amazing editor. It combines and integrates a wonderful NLE, an almost identical copy of Nuke (industry standard compositor), is the industry standard (and for good reason) color grading software, and also has the features of Audition directly inside. DaVinci Resolve is absolutely amazing and so much faster and more modern then Premiere)
---> for open source options, see [KdenLive](https://kdenlive.org/en/) or [Blender](https://www.blender.org). Unfortunately, neither of them are anywhere as mature as DaVinci Resolve for video editing.
After Effects (Compositing) --> [Davinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve)
After Effects (Motion Graphics) --> either[Davinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve) nodes (but can get laggy if too complex), [Blender](https://www.blender.org) (especially good for 3D, even 2D is really good with Grease Pencil and Geometry Nodes. [Blender](https://www.blender.org) has a lot of potential). Another extremely powerful motion graphics software I have been using is a package of [Motion Canvas](https://motioncanvas.io). It is code-based, so unlike [Blender](https://www.blender.org) and [Davinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve) you do have to know how to code some typescript, but it's *extremely* powerful and approaches Motion Graphics from a completely new code based procedural fashion that is so cool.

## Audio
Audition --> Davinci Resolve Fairlight page or [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org)

## Miscellaneous

Media Encoder --> [HandBrake](https://handbrake.fr)
Character Animator --> [Blender](https://www.blender.org) (especially with its rig and grease pencil functionality, any type of animation should be done in Blender)
XD/InDesign etc... --> learn your HTML CSS JS, do it like a real programmer
Adobe Firefly --> Stable Diffusion: See <https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui> and <https://civitai.com>. This stuff is a bit harder too explain, but you can set up your own AI to use, and comes with way more features! does require a GPU with at least like 4GB of VRAM tho. There are also ways to rent GPUs online for really really cheap.
